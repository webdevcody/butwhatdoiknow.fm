      "In this episode, I dive deep into the complex and often toxic world of mom groups on social media. From passive-aggressive comments to outright mom-shaming, we explore how these supposedly supportive spaces can become breeding grounds for competition and judgment. I share personal experiences and observations of how mothers constantly try to one-up each other - from bragging about their children's milestones to criticizing others' parenting choices. We'll discuss why it's so hard for moms to genuinely celebrate each other's successes and how this competitive culture affects maternal mental health. This episode aims to shed light on the dark side of mom groups and encourage more authentic, supportive relationships among mothers.",
