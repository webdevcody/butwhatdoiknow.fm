      "In this episode, I dive deep into the complex and often toxic world of mom groups on social media. From passive-aggressive comments to outright mom-shaming, we explore how these supposedly supportive spaces can become breeding grounds for competition and judgment. I share personal experiences and observations of how mothers constantly try to one-up each other - from bragging about their children's milestones to criticizing others' parenting choices. We'll discuss why it's so hard for moms to genuinely celebrate each other's successes and how this competitive culture affects maternal mental health. This episode aims to shed light on the dark side of mom groups and encourage more authentic, supportive relationships among mothers.",

    description:
      "In this episode, I tackle the elephant in the room: sex. Despite being one of the most natural human experiences, it remains shrouded in shame, embarrassment, and awkward silences. I explore why we're comfortable discussing almost everything else - from mental health to financial struggles - but still blush at the mention of intimacy. Through candid discussion, we'll examine how cultural norms, religious influences, and generational trauma have contributed to making sex such a taboo topic. I share thoughts on why open conversations about sex are crucial for healthy relationships, personal well-being, and society as a whole. This episode aims to normalize discussions about sexuality while maintaining respect and sensitivity.",

    description:
      "In this episode, I explore the power of choice in our daily lives. From choosing whether to engage with triggering social media posts to setting boundaries with people who try to walk all over us, we have more control than we often realize. I share personal experiences about learning to make conscious choices rather than defaulting to passive reactions. We'll discuss how recognizing our freedom to choose - whether it's pursuing our dreams, walking away from drama, or prioritizing our own happiness - can be both empowering and challenging. This episode aims to remind listeners that while we can't control everything, we always have the power to choose our responses and actions.",
